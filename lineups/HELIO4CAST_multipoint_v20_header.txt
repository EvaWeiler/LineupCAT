Each event has unique identifier either from the HELIO4CAST ICMECAT, the HELCATS HIGeoCAT or the DONKI database. 

Comments:

- Spacecraft positions are given in Heliocentric Earth Equatorial Coordinates (HEEQ) coordinates.Parameters: 
01: event: To which multipoint event the row belongs to, unit: integer. 
02: lineupcat_id: Observations that are assigned to the same ICME are given the same ID. unit: string. 
03: event_start_time: For in situ spacecraft, similar to icme_start_time in the ICMECAT. For STEREO-A-HI (HIA),
its the see_launch_time from HIGeoCAT, for DONKI its time21_5 from the DONKI database. unit: UTC. 
04: spacecraft: HIA if the entry refers to observations from STEREO-A-HI; 
STEREO A: SECCHI/COR2, SOHO: LASCO/C2 if the entry refers to coronagraph observations by either STEREO-A or SOHO; 
otherwise the in situ observing spacecraft. unit: string. 
05: sc_heliodistance: Heliocentric distance of the spacecraft at event_start_time. unit: AU. 
06: sc_long_heeq: Heliospheric longitude of the spacecraft at event_start_time, range [-180,180]. unit: degree (HEEQ). 
07: sc_lat_heeq: Heliospheric latitude of the spacecraft at event_start_time, range [-180,180]. unit: degree (HEEQ). 
08: cme_long_heeq: CME longitude, derived either from SSEF30 modeling with STEREO-A-HI 
or SWPC CAT with STEREO A: SECCHI/COR2 or SOHO: LASCO/C2, range [-180,180]. unit: degree (HEEQ) 
09: speed: For in situ observations, the speed over the whole ICME interval (icme_speed_mean in ICMECAT). 
For HIA, the speed derived from SSEF30 modeling in HIGeoCAT; for DONKI, the speed is determined by linearly fitting position/time plots. unit: km/s. 
10: mo_bmax: Only for in situ observations, maximum total magnetic field in the magnetic obstacle interval (mo_start_time to mo_end_time). unit: nT. 
11: mo_bzmin: Only for in situ observations, minimum magnetic field Bz component in the magnetic obstacle. unit: nT (RTN). 
12: catalog_id: the id from either the ICMECAT, HIGeoCAT or DONKI, allowing to look up the event directly in these other catalogs. 
13: source: Solar source region as given in DONKI.
